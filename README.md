# Flood_Prediction_2024
Built a flood prediction system using Random Forest and CNN on 12-band GeoTIFF satellite data.
Achieved 90%+ accuracy and IoU scores up to 0.8 in pixel-wise flood classification.
Applied feature engineering on spectral and elevation data; optimized preprocessing for high-resolution geospatial inputs.
Used TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, and Rasterio for model training and spatial analysis.
Delivered a scalable, data-driven solution for real-time flood risk detection.
